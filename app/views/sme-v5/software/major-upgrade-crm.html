            A purchase that represents a significant shift and change in operations is permitted and classed as a major upgrade - for example, from desktop-based applications to cloud-based software as a service. This includes major upgrades offered by your existing software supplier.

            A software purchase which moves between defined product variations from the same supplier - for example, from Bronze to Silver - is not permitted.
