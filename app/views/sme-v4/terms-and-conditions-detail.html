    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">SME Eligibility and Registration</h2>
<!--    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list&#45;&#45;bullet">-->
      <p>SMEs meeting the SME Eligibility Criteria who wish to apply for a Grant Token shall apply to BEIS by following the registration procedure (as updated from time to time and available at [TBC]).</p>
      <p>In applying for a Grant Token, the SME confirms and warrants and undertakes that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>it meets the SME Eligibility Criteria;</li>
        <li>it accepts these Terms and Conditions;</li>
        <li>any information provided in support of its application is complete, true and accurate;</li>
        <li>it will declare the value of the Grant Token in any future application for Small Amounts of Financial Assistance under Article 364.4 of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (or application for De Minimis aid if the Northern Ireland Protocol applies); and </li>
        <li>the individual who is making the application to BEIS on behalf of the SME is both an employee of the SME and at least eighteen (18) years old.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The SME shall provide all reasonable information and assistance to BEIS (and/or the Scheme Administrator at BEIS’ direction) in determining the SME’s eligibility to receive a Grant Token.</p>
      <p>Following receipt of the SME’s application information, BEIS (and/or the Scheme Administrator at BEIS’ direction) may carry out any checks and investigations it deems reasonably necessary and shall determine at its discretion if the SME is eligible to receive a Grant Token. For the avoidance of doubt, BEIS may determine at any stage following the receipt of the SME’s application and for any reason to decline to issue the Grant Token to the SME.</p>
      <p>The SME agrees and acknowledges that BEIS may choose not to enter into SME Terms and Conditions with any SME or (in accordance with Clause 5.3) may choose to withdraw the Scheme (in whole or in part) at any time. Neither BEIS, nor any Scheme Administrator shall (save to the extent expressly provided in these SME Terms and Conditions) be liable for any costs incurred by the SME through the application process or in connection with the Scheme. Neither BEIS nor the Scheme Administrator give any representation or warranty that any application will be accepted, or that any application will be responded to within any particular timescale.</p>
      <p>The SME agrees and acknowledges that:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the SME Eligibility Criteria may be updated from time to time and the SME shall submit any additional information, in whatever form as reasonably requested by BEIS (and/or the Scheme Administrator), to demonstrate its continued eligibility;</li>

        <li>any provision of false information by the SME in connection with the Scheme may be fraud, which could lead to their Grant Token being rescinded and further action being taken against it, including, without limitation, any action to recover a sum equivalent to the value of any Grant Token issued to the SME; and</li>
        <li>the Registered Vendor shall be permitted to share with BIES (and/or the Scheme Administrator) any SME information reasonably requested by BIES (and/or the Scheme Administrator) in connection with the identification and prevention of any fraudulent practices arising in connection with the Scheme.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the event that the SME disputes any decision taken by BEIS (and/or the Scheme Administrator at BEIS’ direction) in relation to its application, it may follow the Appeals Process.</p>

        <li>where any self certification provided in relation to the Eligibility Criteria is subsequently found to be incorrect, inaccurate or untrue.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where a Grant Token is rescinded, the SME may appeal the decision to rescind, subject to and in accordance with the Appeals Process. </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Subsidy Control</h2>
<!--    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list&#45;&#45;bullet">-->
      <p>The Grant Token is provided as Small Amounts of Financial Assistance (or De Minimis aid for SMEs in scope of the Northern Ireland Protocol) to SMEs and the value of the Grant Token should be declared as such in any future application by the SME for state aid/subsidy.</p>
      <p>After enactment of the Subsidy Control Bill 2021, these Terms and Conditions may be amended to reflect any new legal requirements for subsidies.</p>
      <p>SMEs will be required to self-certify that they are eligible for Grant Tokens and that the receipt of a Grant Token will not put them in breach of this Small Amounts of Financial Assistance (or De Minimis aid for SMEs in scope of the Northern Ireland Protocol) subsidy.</p>
      <p>Participation in the Scheme is made available in accordance with article 364.4 of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which enables the SME to receive up to a maximum level of subsidy (a “Small Amount of Financial Assistance”). The threshold is 325,000 Special Drawing Rights (approximately £330,000.00 at the time of drafting)1 over a period of three financial years. The SME warrants that it either:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>has not received any Small Amount of Financial Assistance subsidy or De Minimis aid (whether from or attributable to BEIS or any other public authority) during the current and two previous fiscal years; or</li>
        <li>has received one or more grants of De Minimis aid or Small Amounts of Financial Assistance subsidy during the current and two previous fiscal years, and that receipt of this Grant Token will not cause them to exceed the limit of 325,000 Special Drawing Rights over a period of three financial years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where the SME has operations based in Northern Ireland in goods or wholesale electricity, or is otherwise deemed to be in scope of Article 10 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, participation in the Scheme is made available in accordance with De Minimis aid which enables the SME to receive up to 200,000.00 EUROs over a period of three financial years. Where the Northern Ireland Protocol applies, the SME warrants that it has not exceeded this threshold.</p>
